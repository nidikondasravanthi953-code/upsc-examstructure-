syllabus
UPSC exam questions are sourced from a combination of the official syllabus, fundamental textbooks like NCERTs, and Previous Year Questions (PYQs), with the content covering current affairs, general studies topics such as history, geography, economics, and polity, as well as the candidate's chosen optional subjects.

Official Syllabus: The most fundamental source is the syllabus provided by UPSC, which outlines the topics and subjects to be covered in the examination.

NCERTs: Books published by the Government of India are a crucial source, often forming the basis for many factual questions in the Prelims stage due to their accuracy and neutrality.

Previous Year Questions (PYQs): Analyzing PYQs is essential as they often reveal the pattern and areas of focus for question framing in both Prelims and Mains.

Standard Textbooks: For specific subjects, standard textbooks are highly recommended. For example, M. Laxmikant for Polity, Bipan Chandra for History, and G.C. Leong for Geography are frequently referenced.

Current Events: For General Studies papers in both Prelims and Mains, contemporary issues and events are a significant source of questions.
